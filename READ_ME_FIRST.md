# Welcome to the project!

If you are reading this, that means that you have begun the first step of our project for the University of North Alabama.

## First things first

This project is going to he hosted on github. I assume that if you are reading this,
  then you at minimum know how to operate the the github website. However, this project 
  is also meant to extend our capabilities and make us more desirable job candidates. 
  To that end, I highly recommend following the link on the Trello board to learn how to 
  use git on the command line. It is a skill that is widely used in our industry.

## Things you need to know

This project will heavily include the use of Python. You don't have to be an expert in it,
  that's part of the reason we are doing this in the first place. BUT, you will need to know
  the basic syntax and how to write a basic program with the language.

With so many people on this project, there will be an expected coding style convention for
  everyone to follow. I have included guidelines for Python, JavaScript, and HTML. Learn them,
  Know them, Live them. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that, no matter what file
  someone is on in the future, the sytax will remain clear, consistent, and easily readable.
Not following these guidelines won't get you kicked off the project or anything like that,
  however, do be prepared to be mercilessly mocked by your peers, earn unflattering nicknames,
  and earn a place at the back of the line whenever we bring food to meetings.

## We will ATTEMPT to use AGILE methodology

I really want to try using an agile approach to this project with bi-weekly scrum meetings. If you
  are unfamiliar with agile methods, or are unfamiliar with scrum meetings, don't worry. We will
  go over how exactly that will work in the first meeting. I promise it's nothing world-ending.


### One last thing

School comes first. If you cannot make a meeting because of class, we completely understand. This
  project should just be a fun side job that you can work on during the weekends If at any time
  you need to take a break from the project to focus on school, we all completely understand. Jump
  back on the project when you are able.

Thank you for being a part of this project and let's make something awesome.
