# Real-Time-Object-detection-API
This is an implementation of a Real-Time Object detection API using Tensorflow andÂ OpenCV

### Requirements
**Anaconda/Spyder/Python 
**Tensorflow (latest_version)
**OpenCV 3.4.0

### Notes

The official tensorflow object detection API link is https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection

To test the API on image files, run the object_detection_tutorial.py

To test the API using the webcam in real_time, run the object_detection_webcam.py
